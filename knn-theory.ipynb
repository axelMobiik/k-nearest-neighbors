    "    K Nearest NEighbors is <strong>classification</strong> algorithm that operates on a very simple principle.\n",
    "    <br>It is best shown through example!\n",
    "    <br>Imagine we had some imaginary data on Dogs and Horses, with heights and weights\n",

    "    Training Algorithm:\n",
    "    <ol><li>Store all the Data</li></ol>\n",

    "    <br>Prediction Algorithm:\n",
    "    <ol>\n",
    "        <li>Calculate the distance from x to all points in your data</li>\n",

    "    Pros:\n",
    "    <li>Very simple</li>\n",
    "    <li>Training is trivial</li>\n",
    "    <li>Works with any nymber of classes</li>\n",

    "    A common interview task for a data scientist position is to be given anonymized data and attempt to classify it, without knowing the context of the data.\n",
